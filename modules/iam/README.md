### High-Level Overview

- AWSServiceRoleForEMRCleanup 
    - Required by EMR.  
    - With enough IAM permissions in-place, this role creates by default when EMR spins up.
    - It was missing for me, so my cluster templates were failing to launch, until I created the role.
- ClusterTemplateLaunchRole
    - Using the service catalog, we can store EMR cluster templates as products.
    - We can assign those products to portfolios.
    - We can grant users access to these portfolios.
    - We can add a launch constraint to these portfolios/products.
    - The launch role of this constraint is responsible for launching the cloudformation template of the EMR cluster.
    - The way I have it coded, it hands over this permission to "EMR_EC2_xxx", the JobFlowRole role associated with the EMR cluster (as defined within the template).
- EMR_DefaultRole
    - This is the ServiceRole of the EMR cluster, as defined in the cluster template
    - Keep an eye on the managed policy.  It is set to be deprecated by AWS.
- EMR_EC2_Admin_Role
    - A custom JobFlowRole that I am working on for the EMR clusers.
    - It and other JobFlowRole roles will be where we assign permissions like accessing databases, etc. for EMR Studio users.
    - You need to account for any of these custom roles in ClusterTemplateLaunchRole.
    - Thie role also would need to be present in the cluster template that you plan to launch.
- EMR_EC2_DefaultRole
    - This is the standard naming convention for the JobFlowRole for EMR studio.
    - I plan on replacing this with more intentional roles (EMR_EC2_Admin_Role, EMR_EC2_Analyst_Role, etc.)
    - Remember, this needs to be accounted for in both the ClusterTemplateLaunchRole and cluster template.
- EMRStudio_Service_Role
    - still working on a good explanation
- EMRStudio_User_Role
    - This assigns the permissions associated with users entering an EMR Studio.
    - We assign this as the user role when creating EMR Studio.
    - It has multiple policies attached (Advanced, Intermediate, and Basic).
    - When we assign users/groups to a studio, we can then assign one of the above session policies.
    - Those policies (Advanced...) allow users to perform a range of things, with the main focus being on whether or not the can create clusters from scratch, using a template, or simply attaching to existing clusters.
    - I prefer defining my clusters (with parameters for flexibility) in templates, then using those.
    - Once you're actually using a cluster, your permissions like which database/files/secrets you can access will be determined by the JobFlowRole.
- lambda-service-role
    - Standard service role for using lambdas.  I'm being pretty liberal with its permissions.
- scheduler-service-role
    - Used for working with schedules in eventbridge.
